    "> For the [first time in 10 years,](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4326) the 2017 summer movie season concluded without breaking \\$4 billion in domestic box office ticket sales. With only \\$3.8 billion in the bank after pulling in \\$4.4 billion in 2016, this marks the worst summer box office performance in a decade, leading several figures in the American movie industry pondering as to what caused such decline.\n",
    "> Shortly after the summer season wrapped up, the [New York Times published an article detailing the responses from various directions and studio executives](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/business/media/rotten-tomatoes-box-office.html) and the common scapegoat for poor ticket sales was online movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes."
